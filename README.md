## What is MetaLog?

A **MetaLog** is a bounded-size statistical and structural fingerprint
of a window of log behaviour. It answers a single question:

> *What was this log stream doing in the last N minutes, in 4 KB or less?*

A MetaLog is **not** a log, **not** a metric, and **not** an alert.
It is a new primitive that sits between raw logs (high entropy, low
signal, expensive to store) and pre-defined metrics (low entropy, lossy,
defined ahead of time):

```
┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐
│   Raw logs       │    │    MetaLog       │    │     Metrics      │
│   (GB / hour)    │ ─▶ │  (KB / window)   │ ─▶ │  (B / sample)    │
│  high entropy    │    │  defined by      │    │  defined ahead   │
│  defined nowhere │    │  the data itself │    │  of time         │
└──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
       observable             compressible           queryable
```

A MetaLog is **derivable from raw logs** (one-way), **composable across
sources and windows**, **diff-able between consecutive windows**, and
**small enough to feed to humans, dashboards, alerting rules, and LLMs
without further reduction**.

---

## Why a spec?

The observability industry stores logs at $0.50–$3 per GB ingested and
queries them with full-text search. This works at small scale and
collapses at large scale: companies routinely drop logs after 7 days
because retention is unaffordable, then have no incident forensics.

The industry response has been *more storage, more indexes, more
dashboards*. The MetaLog response is *compress the meaning, then store
that*. A 1 GB / hour log stream produces ~4 KB / hour of MetaLog. The
compression ratio is the value proposition.

For this primitive to be useful across vendors — for an SRE to be
able to switch their log analyzer without re-training their
dashboards, alerts, and LLM prompts — the format itself must be
**open, versioned, and vendor-neutral**.

That is what this spec is.

## Status of v0

This is a **draft** — v0.x — published to reserve the term, the
schema, and the design intent before incumbents publish a
proprietary equivalent. The format **will** change in incompatible
ways before v1.

The first stable version (v1.0) will land alongside the InSight
reference implementation when its Phase 3 engine ships
(target: Q3 2026). After v1.0, breaking changes follow semver and
[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Reference implementations

| Implementation | Language | License | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **InSight** ([repo](https://github.com/coderoast-dev/InSight)) | C++23 | BSL-1.1 (planned, at v1) | Phase 3 in progress |
| *Your implementation here* | — | — | PRs welcome |

The spec is deliberately implementation-agnostic. Any language that
can serialise the JSON envelope and compute the required statistics
can produce conformant MetaLogs.

---

## Non-goals

To avoid scope creep and to keep the spec implementable, the
following are **explicitly out of scope** for MetaLog:

- **Log storage or retention.** MetaLog says nothing about where raw
  logs live. It is a derived artifact.
- **Log routing or transport.** Use Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel
  Collector, etc. MetaLog is what you produce *from* a log stream,
  not how you move logs around.
- **Alerting policy.** A MetaLog enables alerting; it does not
  prescribe alerts. Wire your own rules on top of MetaLog fields.
- **Querying raw logs.** A MetaLog is lossy by design. If you need
  the original log lines, keep them; MetaLog is not a replacement
  index.
- **Anomaly detection algorithms.** A MetaLog is the *input* to a
  detector. The detector itself is not part of this spec.
- **A wire protocol.** MetaLogs are JSON documents. Move them with
  HTTP, Kafka, files, or carrier pigeons.

## How to contribute

This spec is in the *reserve-the-term* phase. The most useful
contributions right now are:

1. **Implement the v0 envelope in your favourite language** and
   open a PR adding it to the [reference implementations](#reference-implementations)
   table.
2. **Open issues** with concrete log streams where the v0 schema
   does not capture something you'd want a MetaLog to express.
3. **Argue with [`RATIONALE.md`](RATIONALE.md)**. Every rejected
   alternative is documented; if you think one was wrong, say so on
   the issue tracker with a specific scenario.

Process and review rules live in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Trademark / naming note

"MetaLog" is used here as a generic technical term for the artifact
described by this spec. Any vendor may produce or consume
spec-conformant MetaLogs and describe their tool as "MetaLog
producer" or "MetaLog consumer". The spec is permissively licensed
precisely so this term can become standard usage.
